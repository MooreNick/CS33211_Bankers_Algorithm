# CS33211_Bankers_Algorithm

This is my C++ implementation of the Banker's Algorithm. This was completed as part of CS33211 (Operating Systems) at Kent State. The professor for this course is Dr. Guan. Read included documentation file for a walkthrough of the program. 

There are also inline comments throughout the program.

This program was tested on Kent State's wasp/hornet server's using the following commands:
clang++ bankers.cpp
./a.out bankers.cpp input.txt
